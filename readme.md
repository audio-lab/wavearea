## Operations

All operations on audio are reflected in URL as:

```
?src=path/to/audio&clip=300-400&br=100...200...300&del=0-10...10-20&mute=10-20&...
```

Operations are applied to source in turn.
Supported operations are (measured in blocks, each block is 1024 samples wide):

* `src=path/to/audio` â€“ load source file by URL. Can be wav, mp3 or ogg, or any other format supported by browser.
* `norm` â€“ normalize audio - make sure max volume is 1. <!-- TODO: normalize to indicated db value -->
* `clip=offset-to` â€“ slice audio to indicated range.
* `br=offset..offset..offset...` â€“ break audio by segments at indicated points.
* `del=offset-len..offset-len..offset-len...` â€“ delete fragments of audio at `offset`s of length `len`.
* `mute=offset-len..offset-len..offset-len...` â€“ insert silence at indicated points.
<!-- * `fadein=start-duration`, `fadeout=start-duration` -->
