## Operations

All operations on audio are reflected in URL as:

```
?src=path/to/audio&clip=300-400&br=100..200..300&del=0-10..10-20&mute=10-20&...
```

Operations are applied to source in turn.
Supported operations are (measured in blocks, each block is 1024 samples wide):

* `src=path/to/audio` â€“ load source file by URL. Can be wav, mp3 or ogg, or any other format supported by browser.
* `norm` â€“ normalize audio - make sure max volume is 1.
* `clip=from-to` â€“ slice audio to indicated range.
* `br=at..at..at...` â€“ break audio by segments at indicated points.
* `del=from-to..from-to..from-to...` â€“ delete fragments of audio.
